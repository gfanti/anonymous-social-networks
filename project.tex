\subsection{Anonymous Social Networks} 
Recent years have seen the rise of a new class of social network, predicated entirely on anonymous microblogging.
Such networks, including Secret \cite{secret}, Whisper \cite{whisper}, and Yik Yak \cite{yikyak}, enable users to share short messages with their friends without including any authorship information in the metadata. 
Whenever a user `likes' an incoming message, that message passes to the user's friends.
Under this spreading pattern, messages propagate across the network like an epidemic.
While these social networks are anonymous to individual network users, service providers store all communications (along with authorship information) on centralized servers.
The social networks are therefore not anonymous to the service providers themselves, as well as government agencies or hackers who obtain access to these centralized servers.
Our work considers a \emph{different} adversary that is more powerful than a single user, but less powerful than a government agency or service provider.
Because this class of social networks is relatively new, to the best of our knowledge, no existing research exists on deanonymizing them.

These social networks are not the gold standard for anonymous communication, though. In the rest of this section, we will discuss the state-of-the-art in anonymous broadcast communication, and explain why those methods have not gained traction outside the research community.
A wide swath of literature---spanning a few decades---considers the problem of communicating anonymously.
A large portion of this literatures focuses on \emph{point-to-point} communication, offering properties like sender anonymity, receiver anonymity, and/or sender-receiver unlinkability. 
Work in this area includes Chaum's mix-nets \cite{chaum1981untraceable}, Tor \cite{tor}, Tarzan \cite{tarzan}, Crowds \cite{reiter1998crowds}, and Herbivore \cite{goel2003herbivore}, just to name a few.
While this body of literature has been impactful even outside the academic community, it is a different problem than the one we wish to address.

We will instead focus on approaches that enable anonymous \emph{broadcast} communication.
Chaum's seminal work on the dining cryptographers problem launched this area of study \cite{chaum88}.
The problem is as follows: a group of cryptographers goes out to dinner. After the meal, they want to learn if one of them has paid the check, without revealing who paid.
Chaum's solution, known colloquially as a DC-net, requires each cryptographer to flip a coin (in private) with the individuals on his left and right. Each coin flip is hence observed by exactly two people.
Then, each cryptographer publishes the XOR of the two observed coin flips; if cryptographer Alice paid the check, then instead of publishing the true XOR of her coin flips, she publishes the opposite (e.g., a 0 instead of a 1).
To learn the desired information, each cryptographer XOR's all the published bits. If nobody paid the check, this bitwise sum will evaluate to 0; otherwise it will evaluate to 1.
DC-nets offer perfect anonymity, but they also rely on some assumptions that may not realize in practice, such as honest participants, or only one individual communicating at once.

DC-nets launched an area of study on methods for robust, scalable, and anonymous broadcast communication. 
Some of this work focuses on developing new anonymity primitives, such as anonymous broadcast encryption \cite{libert2012anonymous, fazio2012outsider}.
Broadcast encryption aims to send an encrypted message such that only a subset of recipients can decrypt the message.
Classical broadcast encryption schemes require that each recipient know the entire set of intended recipients, which violates recipient anonymity; anonymous broadcast encryption aims to relax this constraint. 
This work is outside our scope, as we are interested in broadcast systems that provide \emph{sender} anonymity.


Another branch of work focuses on refining DC-nets to exhibit better efficiency or robustness properties against threats to protocol security or correctness \cite{waidner1989dining,golle2004dining,corrigan2010dissent}.
For instance, \cite{golle2004dining} proposes new, non-interactive DC-net constructions that enable misbehaving parties to be identified with high probability.
\cite{corrigan2010dissent} extends this work by proposing a DC-net with a \emph{shuffled send} primitive, which helps provide integrity, anonymity, and accountability within the network.
These proposed improvements to DC-nets are efficient given the features they offer, but they are likely to face challenges at an Internet-wide scale.
Advances in the construction of DC-nets have led to various applications, including voting systems \cite{fujioka1993practical,van2010anonymous}, distributed storage \cite{freeHavenProject}, and even point-to-point anonymous messaging \cite{goel2003herbivore}.
The details of these schemes are not important to understanding our current work; the key take-away message is that this body of work only uses ideas from DC-nets on a relatively small scale.
For instance, Herbivore \cite{goel2003herbivore} is a point-to-point messaging system that uses DC-nets to provide sender anonymity---but only within a small cluster of the network.
Using DC-nets to communicate across an entire network would be massively impractical, due to their vulnerability to Sybils, Byzantines, and denial-of-service attacks.

The body of anonymous broadcast research has not yet found its way into a large-scale, widely-adopted social network. 
A number of factors might explain this, including the scalability and security challenges we mentioned, as well as the difficulty of monetizing truly anonymous services.
The end result is that commercial anonymous social networks described earlier, such as Secret and Whisper, have built significant user bases while offering fairly weak anonymity properties.
They consequently present a juicy target for adversaries hoping to learn people's sensitive secrets.
In this work, we study exactly how powerful an adversary must be to deanonymize such a network.

\subsection{Deanonymizing Social Networks}
Researchers have worked on different techniques for deanonymizing social networks. One of the earlier approaches~\cite{backstrom2007wherefore} aims to deanonymize networks 

One recent~\cite{narayanan2009anonymizing} approach focuses on deanonymizing large scale social networks by developing a very generic re-identification algorithm. Social graph anonymizaion usually consists of releasing some partial information on a \emph{sanitized} version of the graph. 
The paper identifies several different types of attackers, including governments, corporations, etc. The attackers are assumed to know some auxiliary information about the graph, designated as $S_{AUX}$, which is a different network such that $S_{AUX}$ and the original network overlap. The algorithm consists of two steps, seed identification and propagation. Seed identification attempt to find a small amount of users that are present both in the anonymized network and the auxiliary graph. The propagation stage then attempts to 

\subsection{Identifying a Rumor Source}
As mentioned previously, we are considering an adversarial model with limited power to create Sybil nodes and potentially convert legitimate nodes into ``spies."
However, we cannot use traditional deanonymization algorithms because our problem is different from the classical formulation. 
In this section, we discuss prior work on statistical inference over graphs; this body of literature will inform our inference algorithms for deanonymizing users.

Over the last five years, the research community has displayed growing interest in the problem of identifying the source of an infection spreading according to some random process. 
This trend started with the work of Shah and Zaman \cite{shah2011rumors}. Their problem is as follows: An infection is propagating over a graph according to a diffusion random process. That is, each infected node infects an uninfected neighbor in an exponentially-distributed amount of time. Given the underlying graph structure and a single snapshot of the infection pattern at a given time, can the ``patient-zero" be inferred? The authors propose a metric called \emph{rumor centrality}, which describes the centrality of a node in the infected subgraph. They present an efficient method for computing rumor centrality and show that when the underlying social network is tree-structured, the node with maximum rumor-centrality is the true patient-zero with high probability. The intuition is that regular, symmetric spreading patterns (like diffusion) tend to place the true source in the center of the infection graph with high probability. 
In simulation, a heuristic adaptation of rumor centrality also proved useful for identifying sources in loopy graphs.

Subsequent work has examined many variants of this problem. Examples include considering more general graph structures \cite{shah2012rumor}, a spy-based adversarial model \cite{pinto2012locating,luo2013identify}.
