\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Anonymous Social Networks} 
Recent years have seen the rise of a new class of social network, predicated entirely on anonymous microblogging.
Such networks, including Secret \cite{secret}, Whisper \cite{whisper}, and Yik Yak \cite{yikyak}, enable users to share short messages with their friends without including any authorship information in the metadata. 
Whenever a user `likes' an incoming message, that message passes to the user's friends.
Under this spreading pattern, messages propagate across the network like an epidemic.
While these social networks are anonymous to individual network users, service providers store all communications (along with authorship information) on centralized servers.
The social networks are therefore not anonymous to the service providers themselves, as well as government agencies or hackers who obtain access to these centralized servers.
Our work considers a \emph{different} adversary that is more powerful than a single user, but less powerful than a government agency or service provider.
Because this class of social networks is relatively new, to the best of our knowledge, no existing research exists on deanonymizing them.

These social networks are not the gold standard for anonymous communication, though. In the rest of this section, we will discuss the state-of-the-art in anonymous broadcast communication, and explain why those methods have not gained traction outside the research community.
A wide swath of literature---spanning a few decades---considers the problem of communicating anonymously.
A large portion of this literatures focuses on \emph{point-to-point} communication, offering properties like sender anonymity, receiver anonymity, and/or sender-receiver unlinkability. 
Work in this area includes Chaum's mix-nets \cite{chaum1981untraceable}, Tor \cite{tor}, Tarzan \cite{tarzan}, Crowds \cite{reiter1998crowds}, and Herbivore \cite{goel2003herbivore}.
While this body of literature has been impactful even outside the academic community, it is a different problem than the one we wish to address.

We will instead focus on approaches that enable anonymous \emph{broadcast} communication.
Chaum's seminal work on the dining cryptographers problem launched this area of study \cite{chaum88}.
The problem is as follows: a group of cryptographers goes out to dinner. After the meal, they want to learn if one of them has paid the check, without revealing who paid.
Chaum's solution, known colloquially as a DC-net, requires each cryptographer to flip a coin (in private) with the individuals on his left and right. Each coin flip is hence observed by exactly two people.
Then, each cryptographer publishes the XOR of the two observed coin flips; if cryptographer Alice paid the check, then instead of publishing the true XOR of her coin flips, she publishes the opposite (e.g., a 0 instead of a 1).
To learn the desired information, each cryptographer XOR's all the published bits. If nobody paid the check, this bitwise sum will evaluate to 0; otherwise it will evaluate to 1.
DC-nets offer perfect anonymity, but they also rely on some assumptions that may not realize in practice, such as only one individual communicating at once.

DC-nets initiated an area of study on methods for robust, scalable, and anonymous broadcast communication. 
Some of this work focuses on developing new anonymity primitives, such as anonymous broadcast encryption \cite{libert2012anonymous, fazio2012outsider}.
Broadcast encryption aims to send an encrypted message such that only a subset of recipients can decrypt the message.
Classical broadcast encryption schemes require that each recipient know the entire set of intended recipients, which violates recipient anonymity; anonymous broadcast encryption aims to relax this constraint. 
This work is outside our scope, as we are interested in broadcast systems that provide \emph{sender} anonymity.


Another branch of work focuses on refining DC-nets to exhibit better efficiency or robustness properties \cite{waidner1989dining,golle2004dining,corrigan2010dissent}.
Advances in this area have led to various applications, including voting systems \cite{fujioka1993practical,van2010anonymous}, distributed storage \cite{freeHavenProject}, and even point-to-point anonymous messaging \cite{goel2003herbivore}.
The details of these schemes are not important to understanding our current work; the key take-away message is that this body of work only uses ideas from DC-nets on a relatively small scale.
For instance, Herbivore \cite{goel2003herbivore} is a point-to-point messaging system that uses DC-nets to provide sender anonymity---but only within a small cluster of the network.
Using DC-nets to communicate across an entire network would be massively impractical, due to their vulnerability to Sybils, Byzantines, and denial-of-service attacks.
These problems have been studied in depth, but even proposed solutions are likely to face challenges at an Internet-wide scale \cite{golle2004dining,corrigan2010dissent}.

The body of anonymous broadcast research has not yet found its way into a large-scale, widely-adopted social network. 
A number of factors might explain this, including the scalability and security challenges we discussed, as well as the difficulty of monetizing truly anonymous services.
The end result is that commercial anonymous social networks described earlier, such as Secret and Whisper, have built significant user bases while offering fairly weak anonymity properties.
They consequently present a juicy target for adversaries hoping to learn people's sensitive secrets.
In this work, we aim to pinpoint exactly how powerful an adversary must be to deanonymize such a network.

\subsection{Deanonymizing Social Networks}
Many social networks have been deanonymized in the past.
This is usually done via correlations with side information. (Discuss methods of deanonymization, and why we can't use them)


\subsection{Identifying a Rumor Source}
As mentioned previously, we are considering an adversarial model with limited power to create Sybil nodes and potentially ``convert" legitimate nodes into spies. In this section, we discuss prior work that will inform our inference algorithms for deanonymizing users.

Over the last five years, the research community has displayed growing interest in the problem of identifying the source of an infection spreading according to some regular random process. 
This trend started with the work of Shah and Zaman \cite{shah2011rumors}.
